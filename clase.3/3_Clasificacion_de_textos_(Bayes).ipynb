      "based on the late 1960's television show by the same name , the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover . \n",
      "however , things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion . \n",
      "of course , the ads make it seem like so much more . \n",
      "quick cuts , cool music , claire dane's nice hair and cute outfits , car chases , stuff blowing up , and the like . \n",
      "sounds like a cool movie , does it not ? \n",
      "after the first fifteen minutes , it quickly becomes apparent that it is not . \n",
      "the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production , complete with nice hair and costumes , but that simply isn't enough . \n",
      "the film is best described as a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video , both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half . \n",
      "and with it comes every single clich ? . \n",
      "it doesn't really matter that the film is based on a television show , as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we've already seen . \n",
      "the characters and acting is nothing spectacular , sometimes even bordering on wooden . \n",
      "claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored , which really transfers onto the audience . \n",
      "the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi , who plays the resident crazy man , ultimately being the only thing worth watching . \n",
      "unfortunately , even he's not enough to save this convoluted mess , as all the characters don't do much apart from occupying screen time . \n",
      "with the young cast , cool clothes , nice hair , and hip soundtrack , it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset . \n",
      "despite an american 'r' rating ( which the content does not justify ) , the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset . \n",
      "information on the characters is literally spoon-fed to the audience ( would it be that hard to show us instead of telling us ? ) , dialogue is poorly written , and the plot is extremely predictable . \n",
      "the way the film progresses , you likely won't even care if the heroes are in any jeopardy , because you'll know they aren't . \n",
      "basing the show on a 1960's television show that nobody remembers is of questionable wisdom , especially when one considers the target audience and the fact that the number of memorable films based on television shows can be counted on one hand ( even one that's missing a finger or two ) . \n",
      "the number of times that i checked my watch ( six ) is a clear indication that this film is not one of them . \n",
      "it is clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar , judging from the rash of really awful teen-flicks that we've been seeing as of late . \n",
      "avoid this film at all costs . \n",

       "['wolfgang petersen\\'s latest , the perfect storm , is like a pineapple . \\nit only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging - if you try to eat the fruit , spikes and all , it\\'s going to hurt ? quite a bit . \\nok , maybe that was a confusing analogy , so here\\'s my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick : there isn\\'t really much of a story to tell . \\nbasically , a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat , called the andrea gail , and gets stuck in the middle of \" the storm of the century . \" \\nhow much time does it take for petersen to tell this story ? \\nnot nearly enough . \\nso he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous . \\naudiences want to see the storm , they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched , maudlin drivel . \\nthe last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect , but just try lasting the first three-quarters . \\ni have yet to read sebastian junger\\'s the perfect storm , but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale . \\nbased on a true story , the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version , the approach is weak . \\nusing a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner , petersen almost hides the in-your-face banality . \\nright away the central characters are introduced : the gritty , determined captain ( george clooney ) , the ingenue ( mark wahlberg ) torn between his job and his girlfriend ( diane lane ) , the loving father ( john c . reilly ) , the comic relief who\\'s always trying to get laid ( john hawkes ) , the new guy ( william fichtner ) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet , french guy ( allen payne ) . \\nso many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer . \\nit is not the all-star cast\\'s fault , just the characters designed for their portrayal . \\nallen payne\\'s character never speaks in the entire movie , not because he is mute , but because he\\'s never given any lines ! \\nare we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with ? \\nfichtner\\'s character is terribly underdeveloped - we don\\'t know what he\\'s doing there , where he\\'s from , or who he\\'s supposed to be . \\nthe remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes ( hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene \" you know what would look good on you ? \\nme ! \" \\nooooh real creative ) . \\nas the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters , the crew continues to not feel human . \\nonly when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk . \\nthe computer-generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real . \\ni can only imagine if this was an imax film , this city kid would surely never go in the water again . \\nthis is loud , jolting entertainment - adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film . \\nthe perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment . \\nthe maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so . \\ni guess i\\'ll stick to that other survival spectacle ? you know the one on cbs ? \\n',\n",
       " 'i have to admit that i disliked this film initially . \\nit certianly isn\\'t for every taste , and it\\'s sheer torture to sit through if you\\'re in a restless mood . \\nthat said , if you are in the right mood , it\\'s absolutely incredible . \\nthis was my second favorite movie of 1998 , and would have been a shoo-in for first in almost any other year . \\nperhaps the big turn-off for many was this film\\'s unconventionality . \\ni\\'d be hard-pressed to compare it to any other film that i\\'ve seen - it is very , very artsy , incredibly slow - and amazingly , it works beautifully . \\non my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i didn\\'t think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it ) . \\nthe first act serves to set up the characters - sort of . \\nit exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness , and perhaps even feelings of boredom . \\nand then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second ( which encompasses most of the movie ) . \\nthe majority of the film is one extended battle scene , intercut with brief flashbacks and voice-overs . \\nthe artsier elements do not detract from the action , but add to it - they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers , only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes . \\nthe battle scenes are amazing ( second only to \" saving private ryan \" in my opinion ) . \\nthey\\'re brutal , horrifying , and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography . \\nthe second act is as immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen . \\nthe only problems come during the first and third acts . \\nmalick takes a little too long to get the film started . \\nalthough the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers\\' experiencing a near-eden-like paradise while going awol , and the preperations for battle - are effective and necessary , hints of pretentiousness sink in . \\nthe film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning , and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this . \\nthe final act is effective at winding the film down , but the problems from the first persist - it\\'s a bit too long , and comes over as pretentious at times . \\nthat said , there are two sequences ( one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife , and another where one of the main characters is killed ) that are nothing short of incredible . \\nthe performances are phenominal all around . \\nthe two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel , both of whom should have been nominated for oscars . \\nnolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation . \\nhis character is hard , mean , and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men , and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him . \\ncaviezel is forever questioning the nature of war , his place in it , and if there\\'s any deeper meaning to the hell that he\\'s going through . \\nhe is absolutely perfect - genuine , sympathetic , sincere , and yet strong when he needs to be . \\nalthough restricted to a relatively small role , sean penn is also very good as the company\\'s pessimistic seargent . \\nas to how it stacks up to \" saving private ryan \" - it was my second favorite movie of 1998 , \" ryan \" was my first . \\nit\\'s really hard to compare the two - they are so , so different - so i won\\'t , beyond saying that spielberg\\'s film had more of an impact on me . \\nhowever , the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality ( i can easily see why someone would \" the thin red line \" above \" ryan ) . \\ni highly recommend both of them , and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made . \\nall in all , \" the thin red line \" is filmmaking of an incredibly high order . \\nit\\'s slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right . \\nit\\'s a real shame that it tanked at the box office - films this unconventional , powerful , and thought-provoking don\\'t come along very often . \\n']"
